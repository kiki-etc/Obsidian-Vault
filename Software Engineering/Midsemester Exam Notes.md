Systems have become increasingly complex. They need to be built more quickly and more effectively. That's where software engineering comes in.
>[!note] What is Software Engineering?
>Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop software in a systematic way. It is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. The goal is to deliver high quality software within a certain time frame, with a given budget.

The fundamental software engineering activities are software specification, development, validation and evolution.
# Software Products
Generic products are stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them. The specification of what the software should do is owned by the software developer and decisions on software change are made by the developer.
Customized products, on the other hand, is software that is commissioned by a specific client to meet their own needs. The specification of what the software should do is owned by the client and they decide what changes are required.
## Attributes of good software
| Characteristic             | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintainability            | It should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers                                                         |
| Dependability and security | This includes reliability, security and safety. It should not cause physical or economic damage. Malicious users should not be able to access the system |
| Efficiency                 | It should not make wasteful use of system resources. It therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, etc.                                         |
| Acceptability              | It must be acceptable to the target users - understandable, usable and compatible with other systems they use                                            |
# Software process activities
Software specification is where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
Software development is where the software is designed and programmed.
Software validation is where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
Software evolution is where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.
<br>Some general issues that affect software include heterogeneity and business and social change, security and trust and scale.
# Application types
Stand-alone applications are ones that run on a local computer. They include all necessary functionality and do not need to be connected to a network.
Interactive transaction-based applications execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. These include web applications, etc.
Embedded control systems are software control systems that control and manage hardware devices. Numerically, they are probably more embedded systems than any other type of system.
Batch processing systems are business systems designed to process data in large batches.
Entertainment systems are primarily for personal use.
Systems for modeling and simulation (self-explanatory).
Data collection systems.
Systems of systems.
# Ethics
Software engineers must behave in an honest and ethically responsible way if they are to be respected as professionals.
<br>**Confidentiality** (should be respected regardless of whether a formal agreement has been signed) and engineers should not misrepresent their **competence** level.
<br>**Intellectual property rights**: Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents, copyright, etc. They should be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.
<br>**Computer misuse**: Engineers should not use their skills to misuse others' computers.
## ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics

>[!warning] The Eight Principles
>1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
>2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
>3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
>4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
>5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
>6. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
>7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
>8. SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
