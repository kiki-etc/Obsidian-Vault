# UML Overview
It offers the opportunity to present the system in two way: a structural/static perspective or a behavioral/dynamic perspective.
<br>Examples of structural/static diagrams:
- Component diagram
- Package diagram
- Deployment diagram
- Class diagram
- Object diagram
- Profile diagram
- Composite structure diagram

Examples of behavioral/dynamic diagrams
- Activity diagram
- Use case diagram
- Timing diagram
- Sequence diagram (works similar to timing diagram)
- Communication diagram
- State diagram
- Interaction overflow diagram

# High-level diagrams
# Use case diagrams
# Class diagrams
Class diagrams represent different objects (showing their member variables and functions) and display how they interact and their relationships.
<br>Different relationships include:
- Association: "has a"
- Inheritance: "is a"
- Composition: collections
# Activity diagrams
# Sequence diagrams
