 ## What it is?
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to design robust and maintainable application and system software.
Old definition: "Software Engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method." -- Ian Sommerville, (2008 - 2024)

_Types of Software (Products)_
1. Generic Software
	This refers to applications that solve problems that are faced by a diverse group of users. Developers of this kind of software do not necessarily need to engage with users directly but rather analyze their needs and respond with software features.
2. Custom (Bespoke) Software
	This kind of software is developed by engineer to meet the very specific needs of an organization. It involves a very close relationship/conversation between software engineers and the institution to ensure that the software system meets their needs.

_Types of Software (in General)_
1. Application Software
2. System Software

## Software Development Life Cycle
<br>Software Development has multiple approaches. The goal is to produce a HIGH QUALITY software system, with a given BUDGET before a given DEADLINE.
- Plan-Driven Approach
- Iterative Approach (Agile)
- Reuse-Oriented Approach (Integration)

| Software Engineering Objectives | Focus                         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Quality                         | Non-functional requirements   |
| Budget                          | Finance and Entrepreneurship  |
| Deadline                        | Project Management + Teamwork |
