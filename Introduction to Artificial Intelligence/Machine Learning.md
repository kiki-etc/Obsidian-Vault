# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

There are two main types:
- **Classification**: used when the output variable is a categorical label. It learns to assign input examples to one of several predefined classes
- **Regression**: Used when the output variable is a continuous value. It learns to predict a numerical value based on input features

## Regression
<br>Regression is a machine learning technique used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It is a supervised learning technique used to  model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). 

Interpreting a regression model:
- Coefficient Interpretation (relevant for Linear Regression Algorithms)
- Residual Analysis
- Predictive Insights
- Decision-Making

Types of regression include Linear, Logistic, Polynomial, etc.

### Linear Regression
<br>It is used to model (as a straight line) the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable. The result is a line of best fit which is an equation of our model.
### Gradient Descent Algorithm
<br>It is an optimization technique used to minimize the cost function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value (direction of steepest descent) of the function during model training.
### Multilinear Regression
<br>A statistical technique that uses several explanatory \[quantitative] 
### Polynomial Regression
<br>It is another type of regression analysis. As opposed to linear, the  polynomial creates a best fit curve based on a given set of data values.
It is very prone to overfitting (which occurs when a model equation fits too closely to the training data such that when new data is introduced it fails).

## Regularization of Regression Models
<br>Regularization is a technique used in regression models to avoid overfitting by shrinking the coefficient estimated to zero.
