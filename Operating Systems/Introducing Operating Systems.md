An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing services to applications and users. It handles tasks such as **memory management**, **process scheduling**, input/output operations, **file management**, and **security**, ensuring that different programs can run efficiently and concurrently while maintaining system stability.
The OS acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware, enabling interaction and resource sharing.
<br>**Main Functions of an Operating System:**
- **Managing Resources:** The OS is responsible for resource allocation, ensuring fair and efficient use of CPU, memory, and devices.
- **Providing a User Interface:** It offers a way for users to interact with the computer, often through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).
- **Running Applications:** It manages the execution of all applications, providing necessary system services, and handling errors.
- **Managing Files:** The OS organizes data storage, handles file access permissions, and maintains directories.

At the base of each operating system are the four essential managers: Memory, Processor, Device and File. computers with Network capabilities also have Network Managers. These managers are accessed and controlled using the User Interface (which can be a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or a Command Line Interface (CLI))
#### Main Memory Management
The Memory Manager, a key component of an operating system, oversees the allocation and management of Random Access Memory (RAM). It ensures that requests for memory are valid and allocates unused space accordingly. When memory becomes fragmented, it may use policies to reorganize it. During shutdown, the contents of RAM are stored on nonvolatile devices like hard drives to prevent data loss. The Memory Manager also protects the OS in memory from being altered, as this could cause instability or crashes.

Additionally, read-only memory (ROM) contains firmware, which includes essential code that starts the computer and loads the operating system. ROM is nonvolatile, meaning its contents persist even when the computer is powered off, unlike RAM, which loses its data when the system shuts down.
#### Processor Management
It decides how to allocate the Central Processing Unit (CPU). An important function is to keep track of the status of each job, process, thread, etc. and handle each process's transition from one state of execution to another. When complete, the manager reclaims the CPU so it can allocate it to the next waiting process.
#### Device Management
It is responsible for connecting with every device that's available on the system and for choosing the most efficient way of moving resources to and from the devices.
Good device management requires that this part of the OS uniquely identifies each device, starts its operation when appropriate, monitors its progress and deallocates the device to make the OS available to the next waiting process.
#### File Management
The File Manager is responsible for tracking all files in the system, including data, program, and application files, and enforcing access policies set by the system designers. It controls which users can access specific files and what actions they can perform, such as read-only or read-and-write access, with permissions adjustable by authorized individuals. Access control is crucial for security.
The File Manager also handles storage allocation on secondary devices, such as hard drives or flash drives, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. It must consider the technical specifics of each device, such as whether files should be stored as large blocks or smaller linked pieces, and handle modifications to stored files accurately.
#### Network Management
Operating systems with networking capability have a fifth essential manager that provides a convenient way for authorized users to share resources. This manager takes overall responsibility for every aspect of network connectivity (requirements of available devices, memory space, CPU, capacity, transmission connections, types of encryption if applicable).
#### User Interface
This is the portion of the OS that users directly interact with.
The GUI relies on input from a pointing device. Specific menu options, desktops and formats vary.
An alternative to the GUI is the CLI, which responds to specific commands typed on a keyboard and offers additional control of computer resources.
#### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing allows operating systems to accommodate remote access to system resources. At its roots, the OS still maintains responsibility for managing all local resources, and coordinating data transfer to and from the cloud.
## Evolution of Operating Systems
#### **1940s: The Dawn of Computing Without Operating Systems**
In the 1940s, the first electronic digital computers, like the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) and the Harvard Mark I, did not have operating systems. These early machines operated in a highly manual fashion, where programs were loaded one at a time using punched cards, paper tape, or by manually setting switches. 
<br>Key characteristics of this era included:
- **Manual Operation**: The entire computer was dedicated to running a single program, and human operators were responsible for setting up the machine, loading the program, and initiating execution. This process was time-consuming and prone to human error.
- **No Multiprogramming**: Only one program could run at a time, and there were no facilities for managing resources like memory or input/output devices. The concept of an operating system to automate these tasks had not yet emerged.
- **Hardware Constraints**: The hardware was limited in terms of processing power, memory, and input/output capabilities, which made it impractical to develop an operating system. Early computers were often used for military and scientific calculations.
