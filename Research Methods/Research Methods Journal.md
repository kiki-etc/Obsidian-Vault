>An Analysis of Dataset Generation Techniques in Developing Countries: A Case Study of Natural Language Processing in Ghana

## Describing the Problem Space
<br>In the contemporary global economy, the ability to collect, manage, and utilize data effectively is very crucial and has been revolutionized by Artificial Intelligence (AI) – which relies heavily on huge datasets. However, there is a significant disparity between developed and developing countries in terms of data collection and surveillance capabilities.
<br>The problem  is mainly the gap in technological infrastructure. The US benefits from very complex interconnected systems, while Ghana (for the most part) lags behind in its attempt to keep up. This causes an inequity in data collection methods and an unreliability of data collected in developing countries like Ghana.
<br>Because of this disparity, Ghana’s machine learning development is significantly hindered, which slows down the application of machine learning technology in the country – something that has been instrumental in innovation in countries like the US. It leaves Ghana with an economic disadvantage.
<br>Addressing these disparities is essential for fostering sustainable economic growth and technological.
## Objectives

Key objectives include evaluating the current state of technological infrastructure in both the US and Ghana, including internet penetration, computing resources, and data storage solutions. Also, there is a need to compare the methods and tools used for data collection in both countries, with an emphasis on data relevant to NLP (e.g., text data from social media, public records, and communication platforms). Lastly, the research will explore how the differences in data collection and surveillance capabilities affect the development and application of NLP technologies in both countries.
<br>How do the disparities in dataset generation between the United States and Ghana impact the development and application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, particularly in addressing the limited data available for varying African accents, with a specific focus on West Africa?

## Significance
<br>This research will help people understand the gap in data collection capabilities between developed and developing countries, particularly focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for underrepresented African accents. It can promote inclusivity by improving NLP technologies for West African dialects, ensuring better accessibility and user experience and contributes to regional economic growth and technological advancement by leveraging NLP for local industries and services. Adds personal and cultural relevance by addressing a real challenge and leveraging the researcher's background in West African dialects.

This aligns well with my objectives to assess technological infrastructure and investigate impact on NLP development as it can help with the provision of practical recommendations for enhancing Ghana's NLP capabilities.

# Literature Review
## Paper 1 \[The State of Natural Language Processing in Africa: An Overview by Ikechukwu Onyenwe and Onyedinma Ebele Grace]
<br>The article aims to address the lack of computational tools and corpora for African Indigenous Languages (AIL), focusing on the design and development of part-of-speech (POS) tagsets and corpora. Despite the large number of African languages and native speakers, there is a significant lack of computational resources for these languages. African languages, especially in the Niger-Congo family, face challenges in text tagging, orthography, tokenization, and the development of suitable POS tagsets due to their complex morphological structures.

The researchers reviewed existing tagsets and corpora designs, analyzed their strengths and limitations, and studied the processes for tagging and morphological analysis. They also discussed the challenges specific to African languages and proposed guidelines for creating new tagsets and corpora.

The article highlights the difficulties in tokenization and morphological analysis for African languages, particularly those in the Niger-Congo family. It provides insights into the design of effective POS tagsets and emphasizes the need for standardized practices to ensure consistency and accuracy in NLP tasks for African languages.

### Similarities and Differences between the paper and my work
c.       Explain how your work is similar or different from the article.

d.       - **Focus on NLP for African Languages**: Both the article and the research topic address the challenges of developing NLP technologies for African languages.

e.       - **Addressing Data Scarcity**: Both emphasize the lack of computational resources and corpora for African languages and aim to bridge this gap.

f.          - **Technological Development**: Both aim to enhance technological capabilities for African languages, with a focus on creating tools that can be widely used and standardized.

g.         

h.       **Differences**:

i.           - **Scope**: The article specifically focuses on the design and development of POS tagsets and corpora, while the research topic has a broader scope, comparing data collection and surveillance capabilities between the US and Ghana and their impact on NLP development.

j.           - **Application**: The research topic is more specific to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies with a focus on addressing varying African accents, particularly in West Africa, whereas the article deals with general NLP challenges and solutions for African Indigenous Languages.

k.        - **Comparative Analysis**: The research topic involves a comparative analysis between a developed country (the US) and a developing country (Ghana), while the article primarily focuses on the technical and methodological aspects of NLP development for African languages without such a comparative element.
