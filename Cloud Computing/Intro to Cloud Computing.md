**Cloud computing**, as defined by the  **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services). These resources can be quickly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with service providers.<br>
**Cloud Computing-as-a-Buffet**:
- The concept of **Cloud Computing** is compared to a buffet, where users can pick and choose services based on their needs. The **buffet process** emphasizes **observation** and **recall** to make decisions on what to consume (use).

There are 5 key characteristics of Cloud Computing (based on NIST definition)**:<br>
1. **Resource Pooling and Multi-Tenancy**:
   - Cloud providers use **multi-tenancy** to serve multiple customers using shared resources without them knowing about each other.
   - Resources like storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth are dynamically assigned to multiple users as needed.

2. **On-demand Self-Service**:
   - Users can provision computing resources (e.g., virtual machines, storage) **automatically** without requiring human interaction with service providers.
   - This gives users flexibility and control over their usage, reducing dependency on IT departments.

3. **Broad Network Access**:
   - Resources are accessible over the network through standard mechanisms (e.g., laptops, mobile phones, tablets) with **minimal effort**.
   - This makes cloud computing highly available to a wide range of devices.

4. **Rapid Elasticity and Scalability**:
   - The ability to **scale resources** up or down based on demand (e.g., during peak times).
   - For example, during Black Friday, online stores can scale up server resources to handle increased traffic.

5. **Measured Service**:
   - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resources using a **metering capability** at various abstraction levels (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth).
   - This means you only pay for what you use, making cloud services cost-efficient.
### **Sustainability Debate: Is Cloud Computing as Sustainable as It Is Portrayed?**
This question challenges the common belief that cloud computing is inherently sustainable.<br>
Key points of debate:
  - **Energy consumption**: Cloud data centers are highly energy-intensive.
  - **Efficiency vs. environmental cost**: While cloud computing consolidates resources (leading to better resource use), it also demands significant **power and cooling** resources.
  - **Sustainability efforts**: Cloud providers (like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) are working to reduce environmental impact through **renewable energy** initiatives, **carbon-neutral programs**, and efficient data center designs.
