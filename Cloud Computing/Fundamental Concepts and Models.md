### Roles and Boundaries in Cloud Computing
**Cloud Provider**:
  - The **organization** that provides cloud-based IT resources.
  - Responsible for delivering services like storage, networking, and virtual machines.
  - Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.

**Cloud Consumer**:
  - An **organization** or **individual** that uses the cloud provider's resources.
  - This entity has a formal contract with the cloud provider to access the services.
  - Cloud consumers include businesses, developers, and end-users.

**Cloud Service Owner**:
  - The individual or organization that **legally owns** a cloud service.
  - This role could overlap with a cloud provider or consumer if the service is deployed for external use.

**Cloud Resource Administrator**:
  - Responsible for administering and managing cloud-based IT resources, including services like storage, VMs, and databases.
  - Handles the operation and maintenance of cloud environments, ensuring that resources are properly allocated and running efficiently.

**Organizational Boundary**:
  - Refers to the **physical perimeter** surrounding the organization's IT resources.
  - Managed by the organization to ensure security, compliance, and performance within its internal IT infrastructure.

**Trust Boundary**:
  - A **logical boundary** that represents the extent to which IT resources are trusted.
  - This boundary can extend beyond the physical network, incorporating third-party services, partners, or external cloud resources.
### Cloud Delivery Models
**Cloud delivery models** represent pre-packaged combinations of IT resources provided by a cloud provider, each offering different levels of control to consumers: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service and Software as a Service.
### **3. Comparison of Cloud Delivery Models**

| **Cloud Delivery Model** | **Level of Control Granted** | **Functionality Available** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **SaaS**                  | Use and basic configurations | Full software application usage through the user interface |
| **PaaS**                  | Moderate administrative control | Manage applications and data while leveraging a pre-configured platform |
| **IaaS**                  | Full control | Manage infrastructure and IT resources, from virtualization to storage |

- **SaaS**: Focus on using the application, minimal customization.
- **PaaS**: Developers control the application and its configurations, limited infrastructure management.
- **IaaS**: Full control over virtual machines, networking, and storage.
### Cloud Deployment Models
Cloud computing can be deployed in various environments, depending on the organization's requirements and the extent of control needed.<br>
1. **Private Cloud**:
   - Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a **single organization**.
   - It can be managed internally or by a third party and hosted either on-premise or off-site.
   - Provides high control, security, and compliance.

2. **Public Cloud**:
   - Infrastructure is owned by a cloud provider and available for the public over the internet.
   - Multiple organizations share the same resources.
   - Economically efficient but less control compared to private cloud models.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**:
   - Combines both private and public cloud infrastructures.
   - Organizations can store sensitive data on a private cloud while using the public cloud for scalable operations.
   - Provides **flexibility** by leveraging both environments based on need.
### Business Drivers for Cloud Adoption
- **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Cloud computing reduces capital expenditures (CapEx) by minimizing the need for physical infrastructure and moving to an operational expense (OpEx) model.
   - **Pay-as-you-go** models allow companies to only pay for the resources they use, preventing overspending.

- **Scalability**:
   - Organizations can scale resources up or down based on demand without investing in additional hardware.
   - Cloud providers handle the elasticity of resources.

- **Flexibility and Agility**:
   - Cloud services allow businesses to deploy applications and services quickly.
   - Reduces time to market for new products and innovations.
### Risks of Cloud Computing
While cloud computing offers numerous advantages, organizations must be mindful of certain risks:<br>
- **Data Security and Privacy**:
   - Storing sensitive information on third-party servers introduces risks related to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations.

- **Downtime and Availability**:
   - Despite high uptime guarantees, cloud services are not immune to outages that can disrupt business operations.

- **Vendor Lock-in**:
   - Moving to a specific cloud provider may lead to **vendor lock-in**, making it difficult to migrate applications and data to another provider in the future.
